# üöÄ Render Deployment Guide - Adding Cloudinary Environment Variables

## Step 1: Get Your Cloudinary Credentials

1. **Sign up at Cloudinary**: Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) and create a free account
2. **Find your credentials**: After logging in, you'll see them on your dashboard:
   ```
   Cloud name: dj1a2b3c4d (example)
   API Key: 123456789012345 (example)
   API Secret: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456 (example)
   ```

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Render

### Option A: Through Render Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Render service**:
   - Log in to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Click on your Smart Dine service

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**:
   - Click on "Environment" tab in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add Environment Variable" button

3. **Add these 3 variables** (click "Add Environment Variable" for each):

   **Variable 1:**
   ```
   Key: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   Value: [paste your actual cloud name here]
   ```

   **Variable 2:**
   ```
   Key: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   Value: [paste your actual API key here]
   ```

   **Variable 3:**
   ```
   Key: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
   Value: [paste your actual API secret here]
   ```

4. **Save and Deploy**:
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Your service will automatically redeploy

### Option B: Through render.yaml (Already Done)

The `render.yaml` file has already been updated with the environment variable placeholders. Render will automatically use the variables you set in the dashboard.

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check deployment logs**:
   - Go to your service dashboard
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for successful deployment messages

2. **Test image uploads**:
   - Visit your deployed Smart Dine application
   - Try uploading a restaurant logo or menu item image
   - Verify the image appears correctly

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Working?
- **Check spelling**: Variable names are case-sensitive
- **No spaces**: Make sure there are no extra spaces in values
- **Restart service**: Sometimes you need to manually trigger a redeploy

### Images Still Not Uploading?
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Check Render logs for error messages
3. Verify your Cloudinary account is active
4. Try with a smaller image file first

### Can't Find Environment Variables Section?
- Make sure you're in the correct service (Smart Dine backend)
- Look for "Environment" in the left sidebar
- If using a different plan, the UI might be slightly different

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Check that all 3 environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify your Cloudinary credentials are valid
3. Look at the deployment logs for specific error messages
4. Try redeploying manually from the Render dashboard

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Cloudinary account created
- [ ] All 3 environment variables added to Render
- [ ] Service redeployed successfully
- [ ] Image upload test completed
- [ ] Images persist after service restart
