# 🔧 Fix Old Image URLs in Database

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

Your new uploads work perfectly, but old images in the database still have `localhost:5000` URLs. This script updates them to use your deployed backend URL.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Fix**

### **⭐ RECOMMENDED: Run on Render**
1. Go to your **smart-dine-backend-1eyi** service in Render
2. Click the **Shell** tab
3. Run this command:
   ```bash
   node fix-image-urls.js
   ```

### **Alternative: Run Locally (Only if you have MongoDB access)**
```bash
cd backend
# Set your MongoDB connection string
export MONGODB_URI="your-production-mongodb-connection-string"
node fix-image-urls.js
```

## 📋 **What the Script Does**

1. **Connects to your MongoDB database**
2. **Finds all records** with `localhost:5000` image URLs
3. **Updates them** to use `smart-dine-backend-1eyi.onrender.com`
4. **Shows progress** as it fixes each record

## ✅ **Expected Output**

```

1. Check that your MongoDB connection string is correct
2. Make sure you're in the `backend` directory
