# 🔧 Fix Old Image URLs in Database

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

Your new uploads work perfectly, but old images in the database still have `localhost:5000` URLs. This updates them to use your deployed backend URL.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Fix**

### **⭐ SUPER EASY: Use the Web Interface**
1. **Open the file:** `FIX_IMAGES_EASY.html` in your browser
2. **Click the button:** "Fix Image URLs Now"
3. **Wait for success:** The page will show you the results
4. **Done!** All your old images are now fixed

### **Alternative: API Call**
If you prefer using an API tool like Postman:
```
POST https://smart-dine-backend-1eyi.onrender.com/api/admin/fix-image-urls
Content-Type: application/json
```

### **Alternative: Command Line (Advanced)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://smart-dine-backend-1eyi.onrender.com/api/admin/fix-image-urls \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## 📋 **What the Script Does**

1. **Connects to your MongoDB database**
2. **Finds all records** with `localhost:5000` image URLs
3. **Updates them** to use `smart-dine-backend-1eyi.onrender.com`
4. **Shows progress** as it fixes each record

## ✅ **Expected Output**

```
